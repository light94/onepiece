onepiece
========
This is a python script to download OnePiece episodes.
First create a folder and download the script in it. The downloaded episodes will be saved in this folder itself.
You need to create a file called last_downloaded.txt and type in the last episode number you saw.
Then run the script. It will ask you how many videos you need to download. It will download that number of videos starting from the last unseen video.
